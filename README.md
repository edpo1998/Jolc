# JOLC

In computer science, an interpreter is a translator (computer program) that repeatedly reads instructions (one at a time) and translates them to machine code. 
It then executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language, without requiring them previously to have been compiled into a machine 
language program. JOLC, is a Julia based programming language that it can be programmed and run from any browser.
